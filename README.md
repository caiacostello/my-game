# Simple Calculator

This is a basic, self-contained calculator implemented in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

## Features

*   Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
*   Clear (C) button
*   Decimal support
*   Handles chained operations (e.g., `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`)
*   Basic error handling for division by zero
*   Minimal and clean design

## Usage

1.  **Save the file**: Save the entire content of `index.html` into a file named `index.html` on your computer.
2.  **Open in browser**: Open the `index.html` file using any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3.  **Interact**: Click the number buttons to input numbers, operator buttons for operations, and the `=` button to get the result. Use `C` to clear the display and reset the calculator.

### Developer Information

*   **Test Cases**: Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing `F12`) to see the results of integrated test cases. Any failed tests will be logged as errors.
*   **Code Structure**: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained within the `index.html` file, making it easy to deploy and use without external dependencies.
